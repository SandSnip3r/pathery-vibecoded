In this project, prefer to commit code frequently with small changes so that experiments can easily be undone. Code should only be commited in a working state; do not commit a partial feature. Before committing code, update accomidating documentation.

Solver Time Limits: When running any solver, you MUST apply a time limit using the --time_limit argument. Default to a 30-second limit. You may use your judgment to propose a longer time limit if the complexity of the puzzle appears to warrant it, but you must state your proposed time limit and reasoning to the user before running.
