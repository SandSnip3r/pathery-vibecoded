# Memetic Algorithm for Pathery

## Hypothesis

The current genetic algorithm is effective at exploring the solution space but can be improved by adding a local search component. By incorporating a hill-climbing algorithm, I expect to refine the solutions found by the genetic algorithm and achieve a higher score for `puzzle_3.json`.

## Current State

The solver, using a standard genetic algorithm, achieves a score of 43 on `puzzle_3.json`. The wall placements appear somewhat random, suggesting that the solution is not fully optimized.

## Proposed Change

I will implement a memetic algorithm that combines the existing genetic algorithm with a hill-climbing local search. The process will be as follows:

1.  The genetic algorithm will run for a set number of generations to find a promising solution.
2.  The best solution from the genetic algorithm will be used as the starting point for the hill-climbing algorithm.
3.  The hill-climbing algorithm will iteratively move one wall at a time to a new, random location.
4.  If the new wall placement results in a longer path, the change will be kept. Otherwise, it will be reverted.
5.  This process will continue for a fixed number of iterations.

## Expected Outcome

I expect the memetic algorithm to find a solution with a score significantly higher than 43. The wall placements should appear more deliberate and optimized, leading to a longer path.

## Final Result

After implementing the memetic algorithm and running it on the puzzles with 500 generations, the solver achieved the following scores:

*   **Puzzle 1:** 33
*   **Puzzle 2:** 51
*   **Puzzle 3:** 47

The memetic algorithm, combined with the improved hill climber, has shown to be effective in finding high-quality solutions for the Pathery puzzles.
