# **Project Status: Hybrid GA-RL Solver**

**Last Updated:** June 30, 2025

This document tracks the implementation progress of the GA-RL Solver as outlined in `ga_rl_solver.md`.

---

### **Part 1: Completed Implementation Steps**

The following components have been successfully implemented and tested:

1.  **Baseline Genetic Algorithm (`GeneticSolver`)**
    *   A fully functional genetic algorithm has been created and is located at `src/pathery/solvers/genetic_solver.py`.
    *   It correctly implements tournament selection, two-point crossover, and mutation.

2.  **Data Collection Framework**
    *   **Puzzle Management:** A script (`scripts/download_puzzles.py`) has been created to programmatically download new "Ultra Complex Unlimited" (UCU) puzzles. All UCU puzzles are now consolidated in the `data/puzzles/ucu/` directory for focused data generation.
    *   **Mutation Variety:** The `GeneticSolver`'s mutation operator was enhanced to generate data for all three required action types: `MOVE`, `ADD`, and `REMOVE`, ensuring a balanced dataset for training.
    *   **Robust Logging:** The data logger now creates a separate log file for each concurrent process (`output/logs/mutations_{PID}.jsonl`) to prevent file corruption and data loss. A script (`scripts/combine_logs.py`) is ready to merge these files.
    *   **Batch Processing:** A new script, `run_data_collection.py`, has been created to manage data generation in controlled batches, preventing system overload.

3.  **Reinforcement Learning Agent (`DQNAgent`)**
    *   The core `DQNAgent` class has been implemented in `src/pathery/rl/dqn_agent.py`.
    *   It utilizes `JAX` and `Flax` for its implementation.
    *   The three-headed CNN architecture, experience replay buffer, and training step (loss function and backpropagation) are complete.
    *   **TensorBoard Logging:** The `train_dqn.py` script now includes robust TensorBoard logging to monitor training progress, including loss metrics.

4.  **Hybrid Solver (`HybridGASolver`)**
    *   The final `HybridGASolver` has been implemented in `src/pathery/solvers/hybrid_ga_solver.py`.
    *   It correctly integrates the `DQNAgent` to handle mutations and has been registered with the main solver factory.

### **Part 2: Current Status & Next Steps**

This section outlines the work that is currently in progress and what will be done next.

1.  **COMPLETED: Offline Data Generation**
    *   **Action:** A large-scale data generation process has been completed. The `run_data_collection.py` script was used to run the `GeneticSolver` on all puzzles for 100 generations each.
    *   **Goal:** To produce a large and diverse dataset of `(state, action, reward)` tuples for offline training. Empty log files have been removed.

2.  **COMPLETED: Dataset Balancing**
    *   **Action:** The `train_dqn.py` script has been updated to create a balanced dataset for training. It now oversamples positive rewards and undersamples zero and negative rewards.
    *   **Goal:** To prevent the model from being biased towards inaction and to ensure it learns effectively from the sparse positive rewards.

3.  **NEXT: Offline Q-Network Training**
    *   **Action:** Run the `train_dqn.py` script with the `combined_mutations.jsonl` dataset.
    *   **Command:** `python train_dqn.py combined_mutations.jsonl`
    *   **Goal:** To pre-train the DQN on the balanced data, generating the initial `dqn_model.safetensors` weights.

4.  **UPCOMING: Online Fine-Tuning and Final Validation**
    *   **Action:** I will modify the `HybridGASolver` to load the pre-trained model weights and implement the final online training loop with epsilon decay.
    *   **Goal:** To have a fully functional hybrid solver that can solve puzzles while continuously learning and fine-tuning its policy.
